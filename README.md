→ fluid not rigid
→ iterative not waterfall
→ easy not complex
→ built for brownfield not just greenfield
→ scalable from personal projects to enterprises
```

> [!TIP]
> **New workflow now available!** We've rebuilt OpenSpec with a new artifact-guided workflow.

## See it in action

```text
You: /opsx:explore
AI:  What would you like to explore?
You: I want dark mode but I'm not sure how to do it cleanly.
AI:  Let me look at your styling setup...
     Cleanest path here: CSS variables + a small theme context,
     with system-preference detection. No new dependencies. Scope it?
You: Yes, let's do it.

You: /opsx:propose add-dark-mode
AI:  Created openspec/changes/add-dark-mode/
     ✓ proposal.md — why we're doing this, what's changing
     ✓ specs/       — requirements and scenarios
     ✓ design.md    — technical approach
     ✓ tasks.md     — implementation checklist
     Ready for implementation!

You: /opsx:apply
AI:  Using change: add-dark-mode (schema: spec-driven, tddMode: default)
     Tasks (4 pending):
     ○ 1.1 Add theme context provider
     ○ 1.2 Create toggle component
     ○ 2.1 Add CSS variables
     ○ 2.2 Wire up localStorage

     ● 1.1 Add theme context provider → writing test (RED) → GREEN ✓
     ● 1.2 Create toggle component    → writing test (RED) → GREEN ✓
     ● 2.1 Add CSS variables          → no scenario closed, code complete ✓
     ● 2.2 Wire up localStorage       → writing test (RED) → GREEN ✓
     All tasks complete! (4/4)

You: /opsx:archive
AI:  Archived to openspec/changes/archive/2025-01-23-add-dark-mode/
     Specs updated. Ready for the next feature.
```

<summary><strong>Optional discipline tools</strong></summary>

Add any of these before or around the core flow to raise alignment and correctness:

```text
You: /opsx:probe add-dark-mode
AI:  (grilling — one question at a time, depth-first, evidence-backed)
     L1 Scope: what problem, why now, what's out of scope?
     L2 Impact: which specs touched, which modules, what depends on this?
     ...
     L6 Open assumptions: [ASSUMED] CSS variable naming not confirmed
     Report: openspec/changes/add-dark-mode/probe-report.md
     Next: /opsx:propose add-dark-mode — it will read this report.

You: /opsx:constitution
AI:  Reviewing config for plan-level MUST/SHOULD candidates...
     [constitution] "Requirements MUST describe observable behavior" → clause I
     [linter] "Always use path.join()" → ESLint rule, skip
     Wrote: openspec/constitution.md

You: /opsx:analyze add-dark-mode
AI:  Constitution Alignment — 2 clauses, 0 waivers
     ✓ I. Product behavior language (MUST) — all requirements pass
     ✓ II. Simplicity first (SHOULD) — design stays minimal
     Coverage pass: all requirements map to tasks
     No issues found. Safe to apply.

You: /opsx:handoff add-dark-mode
AI:  Compacted session into docs/handoff/2026-06-25-add-dark-mode.md
     Open a fresh agent and point it at the doc to continue.
```

- **`/opsx:probe`** — depth-first grilling before propose; saves a `probe-report.md` that `/opsx:propose` reads automatically
- **`/opsx:constitution`** — one-time project setup; draft plan-level MUST/SHOULD invariants in `openspec/constitution.md`
- **`/opsx:analyze`** — read-only pre-apply audit; checks artifacts against the constitution; MUST violations are advisory-blocking
- **`/opsx:handoff`** — compact the current session into `docs/handoff/` so a fresh agent can pick up the work

See the [discipline guide](docs/opsx-discipline-guide.md) for full usage.

## Why teams adopt OpenSpec

Solo, OpenSpec keeps you and your AI honest on a single repo. On a team, the hard part moves: a feature spans the API server, the web app, and a shared library; requirements are owned by one team and consumed by others; planning starts before any code exists.

**[Stores](docs/stores-beta/user-guide.md)** are the answer — planning in a repo of its own. The same `openspec/` shape you already know (specs and changes), shared by `git push` like anything else. One source of truth your whole team and every coding agent can read, across every repo.

- **Cross-repo features** — one change, one plan, even when the code lands in three repos.
- **Shared requirements** — a platform team owns the specs; product teams reference them read-only, right where their coding agent can read them. No drifting wiki.
- **Plan before code** — capture the plan in the store now; the code repos catch up later.

> Stores are in **beta**. Start with the [Stores User Guide](docs/stores-beta/user-guide.md).

## Quick Start

**Requires Node.js 20.19.0 or higher.**

Install OpenSpec globally:

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
```

Then navigate to your project directory and initialize:

```bash
cd your-project
openspec init
```

Now talk to your AI:

- **Not sure what to build yet?** Start with `/opsx:explore`, a no-stakes thinking partner that reads your code, weighs options, and shapes a plan before anything is written. ([Explore guide](docs/explore.md))
- **Already know what you want?** Go straight to `/opsx:propose <what-you-want-to-build>`.

Both are in the default profile. If you want the expanded workflow (`/opsx:new`, `/opsx:continue`, `/opsx:ff`, `/opsx:verify`, `/opsx:bulk-archive`, `/opsx:onboard`), select it with `openspec config profile` and apply with `openspec update`.

> [!NOTE]
> Not sure if your tool is supported? [View the full list](docs/supported-tools.md) – we support 25+ tools and growing.
>
> Also works with pnpm, yarn, bun, and nix. [See installation options](docs/installation.md).

## Community schemas

Third-party schema bundles distributed via standalone repositories — these provide opinionated workflows that integrate OpenSpec with other tools, similar to how [github/spec-kit's community extension catalog](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/tree/main/extensions) handles tool integrations.

→ **[Browse the catalog](docs/customization.md#community-schemas)** in the customization docs.


## Why OpenSpec?

AI coding assistants are powerful but unpredictable when requirements live only in chat history. OpenSpec adds a lightweight spec layer so you agree on what to build before any code is written.

- **Agree before you build** — human and AI align on specs before code gets written
- **Stay organized** — each change gets its own folder with proposal, specs, design, and tasks
- **Track progress live** — `/opsx:apply` registers each task upfront so you can watch them move from pending → in progress → done in real time
- **Work fluidly** — update any artifact anytime, no rigid phase gates
- **Use your tools** — works with 30+ AI assistants via slash commands

### How we compare

**vs. [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)** (GitHub) — Thorough but heavyweight. Rigid phase gates, lots of Markdown, Python setup. OpenSpec is lighter and lets you iterate freely.

**vs. [Kiro](https://kiro.dev)** (AWS) — Powerful but you're locked into their IDE and limited to Claude models. OpenSpec works with the tools you already use.

**vs. nothing** — AI coding without specs means vague prompts and unpredictable results. OpenSpec brings predictability without the ceremony.

## Updating OpenSpec

**Upgrade the package**

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
```

**Refresh agent instructions**

Run this inside each project to regenerate AI guidance and ensure the latest slash commands are active:

```bash
openspec update
```

## Usage Notes

**Model selection**: OpenSpec works best with high-reasoning models. We recommend Codex 5.5 and Opus 4.7 for both planning and implementation.

**Context hygiene**: OpenSpec benefits from a clean context window. Clear your context before starting implementation and maintain good context hygiene throughout your session.

## Contributing

**Small fixes** — Bug fixes, typo corrections, and minor improvements can be submitted directly as PRs.

**Larger changes** — For new features, significant refactors, or architectural changes, please submit an OpenSpec change proposal first so we can align on intent and goals before implementation begins.

When writing proposals, keep the OpenSpec philosophy in mind: we serve a wide variety of users across different coding agents, models, and use cases. Changes should work well for everyone.

**AI-generated code is welcome** — as long as it's been tested and verified. PRs containing AI-generated code should mention the coding agent and model used (e.g., "Generated with Claude Code using claude-opus-4-5-20251101").

### Development

- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Build: `pnpm run build`
- Test: `pnpm test`
- Develop CLI locally: `pnpm run dev` or `pnpm run dev:cli`
- Conventional commits (one-line): `type(scope): subject`
